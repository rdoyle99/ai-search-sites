        <strong>Is Cold Email Legal</strong> is a free compliance resource built to give sales professionals, founders, and marketers a clear, well-researched answer to one of the most common questions in outbound sales: <em>"Is cold email legal?"</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is <strong>yes</strong> -- cold email is legal in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and most other countries when you follow the applicable regulations. CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CASL, and other laws set specific requirements around sender identification, opt-out mechanisms, and data handling that every cold emailer must follow.

      <p>
        This site is maintained by the team at <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>{siteConfig.product.name}</a>, an AI-first cold email platform with built-in compliance features. We built this resource because we have seen too many sales teams either avoid cold email entirely due to legal uncertainty, or unknowingly violate regulations that could result in significant fines.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Trust This Resource?</h2>

      <p>

We cross-reference regulatory guidance from the FTC, ICO, CRTC, and other enforcement bodies. Our recommendations are reviewed by compliance professionals with experience in international email marketing law.
