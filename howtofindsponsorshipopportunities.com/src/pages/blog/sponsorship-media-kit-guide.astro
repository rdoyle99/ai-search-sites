    <div class="mt-8 prose prose-lg max-w-none">

      <p>A media kit is your sponsorship resume. It is the document that converts brand interest into signed deals. When a brand partnership manager evaluates whether to sponsor you, they make the decision based on the data, presentation, and professionalism of your media kit&mdash;not your DMs, not your follower count alone, and not how enthusiastic your pitch email sounds.</p>

      <p>Yet 62% of creators approaching brands for sponsorships do not have a media kit at all. Of those who do, most include generic screenshots of their follower count and little else. The creators who consistently close sponsorship deals at premium rates have media kits that address every question a brand might ask before they ask it. This guide shows you exactly how to build one.</p>

      <h2>What Goes in a Sponsorship Media Kit</h2>

      <p>A complete media kit has seven sections. Each section answers a specific question that the brand&rsquo;s decision-maker needs answered. Missing any section creates friction, and friction kills deals.</p>

      <h3>1. Introduction and Brand Statement (Page 1)</h3>

      <p>Your media kit opens with a concise summary of who you are, what you create, and who your audience is. This should be 2&ndash;3 sentences maximum. Think of it as your elevator pitch in written form. Include your name or brand name, your primary platform, your content niche, and your audience size.</p>

      <p>Example: &ldquo;TechReview Weekly is a YouTube channel and newsletter covering B2B SaaS tools for growing startups. We reach 28,000 subscribers on YouTube and 12,000 newsletter readers, primarily startup founders and product managers in the US and UK.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Include a professional headshot or brand logo. First impressions matter, and a polished opening page signals that the rest of the kit will be equally professional.</p>

      <h3>2. Audience Demographics (Page 2)</h3>

      <p>This is the most important section of your media kit. Brands sponsor creators to reach specific audiences, and they need data to confirm your audience matches their target customer. Include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Age distribution:</strong> Break down your audience by age bracket (18&ndash;24, 25&ndash;34, 35&ndash;44, etc.) using platform analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Gender split:</strong> The percentage of male, female, and non-binary audience members.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographic distribution:</strong> Top 5 countries and, if relevant, top cities. US and UK audiences command premium rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Income/profession indicators:</strong> If available through surveys or platform data, include income brackets or job titles. A B2B audience of decision-makers is worth significantly more than a general consumer audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Interests and affinities:</strong> What topics, brands, or activities does your audience care about? This helps brands assess alignment beyond basic demographics.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Present this data with clean charts and graphs, not raw numbers. Visual data is processed faster and looks more professional. Use your platform&rsquo;s built-in analytics (YouTube Studio, Instagram Insights) as the data source, and update the numbers quarterly to ensure accuracy.</p>

      <h3>3. Engagement Metrics (Page 3)</h3>

      <p>Follower count is a vanity metric. Brands care about engagement because engagement predicts campaign performance. Include the following metrics for each platform:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Metric</th>
            <th>What It Shows</th>
            <th>Good Benchmark</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Engagement Rate</td>
            <td>Audience interaction relative to size</td>
            <td>3%+ (Instagram), 5%+ (YouTube)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Average Views/Impressions</td>
            <td>Actual reach per piece of content</td>
            <td>30%+ of followers (YouTube)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Comments per Post</td>
            <td>Depth of audience engagement</td>
            <td>Varies by niche</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Click-Through Rate</td>
            <td>Ability to drive action</td>
            <td>2%+ (newsletter), 1%+ (social)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Open Rate</td>
            <td>Newsletter audience quality</td>
            <td>40%+ (newsletter)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Save/Share Rate</td>
            <td>Content quality signal</td>
            <td>1%+ (Instagram)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Always present engagement metrics alongside audience size. &ldquo;28,000 YouTube subscribers with 8,400 average views per video (30% view rate) and 5.2% engagement rate&rdquo; is infinitely more compelling than just &ldquo;28,000 subscribers.&rdquo;</p>

      <h3>4. Content Samples and Highlights (Page 4)</h3>

      <p>Include 3&ndash;5 examples of your best content. For each piece, show a thumbnail or screenshot, the title, view/engagement count, and a one-line description of why it performed well. Choose content that demonstrates the type of sponsored integration you would deliver&mdash;if you are pitching video sponsorships, show your best videos; if newsletter sponsorships, show your highest-performing issues.</p>

      <p>If you have previous sponsored content that performed well, feature it prominently. Brands want to see that you can integrate their product naturally into your content style. A case study from a past sponsor showing views, clicks, and conversions is the single most persuasive element you can include.</p>

      <h3>5. Sponsorship Packages and Rate Card (Page 5)</h3>

      <p>Define 2&ndash;4 sponsorship tiers with clear deliverables and pricing. Tiered pricing gives brands options and makes your rates feel structured rather than arbitrary. A typical structure:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tier 1 &ndash; Social mention:</strong> A dedicated post or story mention. Lowest price, lowest commitment.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 2 &ndash; Integrated content:</strong> A 60&ndash;90 second integration within a video, a dedicated newsletter section, or a podcast ad read. This is the most common sponsorship format.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 3 &ndash; Dedicated content:</strong> An entire video, podcast episode, or newsletter issue focused on the sponsor&rsquo;s product. Highest value, highest price.</li>
        <li><strong>Tier 4 &ndash; Ongoing partnership:</strong> A multi-month package combining multiple content types. Offers the brand sustained visibility and gives you predictable revenue.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>List specific prices or price ranges for each tier. Brands expect to see numbers. Vague language like &ldquo;rates available upon request&rdquo; creates unnecessary friction and signals that you have not thought through your pricing. Use our <a href="/tools/sponsorship-rate-calculator/">sponsorship rate calculator</a> to determine appropriate rates based on your audience size and engagement.</p>

      <h3>6. Past Partnerships and Testimonials (Page 6)</h3>

      <p>Social proof closes deals. If you have worked with brands before&mdash;even small ones&mdash;include logos, brief descriptions of what you delivered, and any performance metrics you can share. A testimonial quote from a past brand partner is worth more than any stat in your media kit.</p>

      <p>If you have not done sponsored content before, include any relevant collaborations: guest appearances on other channels, cross-promotions with other creators, or affiliate program results. Even indirect evidence of your ability to drive results for external partners builds credibility.</p>

      <h3>7. Contact Information and Next Steps (Page 7)</h3>

      <p>End with clear contact information and a specific call to action. Include your email, preferred contact method, and a line like &ldquo;Reply to this email or book a 15-minute call at [calendar link] to discuss partnership opportunities.&rdquo; Make it as easy as possible for the brand to take the next step.</p>

      <h2>Design and Format Best Practices</h2>

      <p>Your media kit should be a PDF, ideally 5&ndash;8 pages. Keep the design clean and professional&mdash;consistent fonts, a cohesive color scheme, and plenty of white space. Use tools like Canva (free), Figma, or Adobe InDesign for design. Canva specifically offers media kit templates that provide a professional starting point.</p>

      <p>File size matters. Keep the PDF under 5MB so it can be emailed without issues. Compress images before inserting them. Name the file professionally: &ldquo;YourBrand-MediaKit-2026.pdf&rdquo; not &ldquo;mediakit-final-v3-FINAL.pdf.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Update your media kit quarterly at minimum. Stale data undermines credibility. If your YouTube channel grew from 20K to 35K subscribers, your media kit should reflect the current number. Schedule a quarterly reminder to pull fresh analytics and update all metrics.</p>

      <h2>Media Kit Mistakes That Lose Deals</h2>

      <p><strong>No audience data.</strong> The number one reason brands pass on creators is insufficient audience information. If you cannot tell a brand who your audience is, they cannot justify spending money to reach them. Include demographic data even if it is not perfect&mdash;imperfect data beats no data.</p>

      <p><strong>Inflated or misleading metrics.</strong> Brands verify claims. If your media kit says &ldquo;50,000 monthly views&rdquo; and your public YouTube analytics show 15,000, you lose all credibility instantly. Report accurate numbers and let the quality of your audience speak for itself.</p>

      <p><strong>No pricing.</strong> Brands reach out to dozens of creators simultaneously. The ones who provide clear pricing move forward faster because the brand can immediately assess budget fit. Hidden pricing slows the process and often means you get passed over for a creator who made the decision easier.</p>

      <p><strong>Poor design quality.</strong> If your media kit looks like it was made in 5 minutes using Microsoft Word, brands will question whether your content quality meets their standards. Invest 2&ndash;3 hours in making the design polished. It does not need to be perfect&mdash;it needs to be professional.</p>

      <p><strong>Generic positioning.</strong> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lifestyle creator&rdquo; tells the brand nothing about your audience. &ldquo;I review productivity tools for remote workers and startup founders, with a focus on tools under $50/month&rdquo; tells the brand exactly which products they can promote. Be specific about your niche.</p>

      <h2>How to Deliver Your Media Kit</h2>

      <p>Attach your media kit to your initial outreach email. Do not wait for the brand to request it&mdash;proactive delivery signals professionalism and gives the brand everything they need to make a decision in a single email. In your pitch email, reference the media kit: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve attached my media kit with audience demographics, engagement metrics, and sponsorship packages.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Also host your media kit as a downloadable link on your website. Create a simple /sponsors or /partners page with a brief overview and a download button. This serves creators who find your content organically and want to explore sponsorship without direct outreach. Some creators use a &ldquo;link in bio&rdquo; tool to include their media kit link alongside other important URLs.</p>

      <p>For marketplace platforms (Grin, AspireIQ, Collabstr), upload your media kit as a profile attachment. Many brands browsing these platforms download media kits before initiating contact, so having yours available gives you an advantage over creators who only have a basic profile.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>A professional media kit is the difference between getting ignored and getting sponsored. It transforms your sponsorship pitch from a vague request into a concrete business proposal. Invest the time to build one, keep it updated, and include it in every brand interaction. The creators who close deals consistently are not necessarily the ones with the biggest audiences&mdash;they are the ones who make the brand&rsquo;s decision easy. A great media kit is how you do that.</p>
