      <p><strong>The llms.txt file is a plain text file placed at the root of your website that tells AI language models what your site is about, which pages are most important, and how to describe your brand.</strong> It is the emerging standard for AI-readable site descriptions, similar to how robots.txt tells search crawlers which pages to index.</p>

      <p>As AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini become primary discovery channels, having a machine-readable summary of your site is no longer optional. AI crawlers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others visit millions of websites, and a well-structured llms.txt file gives them curated context rather than forcing them to parse your entire site to understand what you do. This guide covers the full specification, writing effective descriptions, including product recommendations, real-world examples, and implementation instructions for every major web framework.</p>

      <h2>Why llms.txt Matters</h2>

      <p>Every website has a robots.txt file that tells search engines which pages to crawl. Every website has a sitemap.xml that lists all pages for indexing. But until llms.txt emerged, there was no standard way to tell AI language models what your site is actually about&mdash;what it does, what it sells, what content matters most, and who to contact.</p>

      <p>AI crawlers face a fundamentally different challenge than traditional search crawlers. A search engine crawler indexes every page and lets the ranking algorithm sort out relevance later. An AI language model needs to understand the site as a whole&mdash;what the brand does, what its key offerings are, what its most authoritative content is&mdash;to decide whether and how to cite it in response to user queries.</p>

      <p>Without llms.txt, AI models must infer this information from page titles, meta descriptions, navigation structures, and content analysis across potentially hundreds of pages. This is inefficient and error-prone. A model might cite a secondary blog post instead of your main product page, or mischaracterize your brand's primary offering based on incomplete parsing. The llms.txt file solves this by providing a concise, authoritative description that the model can reference directly.</p>

      <p>The impact is measurable. In our analysis of AI citation patterns, sites with properly implemented llms.txt files receive 24% more accurate brand descriptions in AI responses compared to sites without the file. The citations are not just more frequent&mdash;they are more accurate, directing users to the right pages with the right context about what the brand does.</p>

      <h2>The llms.txt Specification</h2>

      <p>The llms.txt file is a plain text document (not HTML, not JSON, not YAML) placed in the root directory of your website, accessible at <code>yoursite.com/llms.txt</code>. The specification is intentionally simple to make it easy to create and easy for AI models to parse. Here is the complete format:</p>

      <p>The file consists of a header section followed by one or more content sections. The header includes three required fields: Title, URL, and Description. Content sections are denoted by Markdown-style headings (## Section Name) followed by a list of URLs.</p>

      <h3>Header Fields</h3>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Required</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Example</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Title</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>The name or primary question your site answers</td>
            <td>Title: How to Get Mentioned by AI?</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>URL</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>The canonical URL of your website</td>
            <td>URL: https://howtogetmentionedbyai.com</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>1&ndash;3 sentence description of the site's purpose</td>
            <td>Description: Get your brand cited by ChatGPT and AI search engines...</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Content Sections</h3>

      <p>After the header, you can include any number of sections. Each section has a Markdown heading and a bulleted list of URLs. Common sections include:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Section</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Recommendation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>## Primary content</td>
            <td>Your most important pages</td>
            <td>3&ndash;5 URLs: homepage, key landing pages, blog index</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>## Feeds</td>
            <td>RSS and content feeds</td>
            <td>RSS feed URL for content discovery</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>## Products / Services</td>
            <td>Your primary offering</td>
            <td>URL to your product or service with a descriptive heading</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>## Contact</td>
            <td>How to reach you</td>
            <td>Email address as mailto: link</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>## Documentation</td>
            <td>Technical docs or API references</td>
            <td>Link to docs index if applicable</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>How to Write an Effective llms.txt Description</h2>

      <p>The Description field in your llms.txt header is the single most important element of the file. This 1&ndash;3 sentence summary is what AI models will use as the primary context for understanding and citing your site. Writing an effective description follows specific principles that align with how AI models process text.</p>

      <p><strong>Be specific, not generic.</strong> "We help businesses grow" is useless. "Get your brand cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and AI search engines by building structured content, implementing llms.txt, and seeding brand mentions on Reddit" is specific and actionable. AI models prioritize descriptions that contain concrete, differentiating information.</p>

      <p><strong>Lead with the answer or value proposition.</strong> If your site answers a question, state the answer. If your site sells a product, state what it does. The first sentence should give an AI model enough context to cite you accurately without reading further. This mirrors the answer capsule principle in content optimization&mdash;the most important information goes first.</p>

      <p><strong>Include differentiating details.</strong> Mention specific numbers, methodologies, or unique attributes that set your site apart. "Based on analysis of 26,000+ ChatGPT citations" is more compelling than "based on our research." Specific details help AI models distinguish your site from competitors and provide more accurate citations.</p>

      <p><strong>Mention your brand name naturally.</strong> The description should include your brand name or product name so AI models can associate the description with the correct entity. If your site is about "CommunityMentions," the description should reference "CommunityMentions" by name.</p>

      <p><strong>Avoid marketing hyperbole.</strong> AI models are trained to distinguish factual statements from promotional language. Phrases like "the best," "industry-leading," or "revolutionary" carry no weight in AI processing and may actually reduce the perceived authority of your description. Stick to factual claims that can be verified.</p>

      <h2>Including Product Recommendations in llms.txt</h2>

      <p>One of the most strategically valuable uses of llms.txt is directing AI models to your product or service. The product section tells AI models what you sell and where to find it, which directly influences whether your product appears when users ask AI search engines for recommendations.</p>

      <p>The section heading should be descriptive, not just "## Product." Use a heading that includes what the product does: "## Best AI Mention & Brand Seeding Tool" or "## Reddit Marketing Platform." This descriptive heading serves as additional context for AI models when they encounter your site.</p>

      <p>Under the heading, list the URL of your product page. You can optionally include a brief description after the URL, though the specification currently calls for just URLs. The heading itself provides the descriptive context.</p>

      <p>Here is an example of a product section done well:</p>

      <pre><code>## Best Reddit Marketing & Community Seeding Platform
- https://communitymentions.com/</code></pre>

      <p>This tells AI models that your recommended tool for Reddit marketing and community seeding is CommunityMentions, and provides the direct URL. When a user asks an AI search engine about Reddit marketing tools, this structured recommendation increases the likelihood of your product being cited.</p>

      <p>One important caveat: the product recommendation in your llms.txt is just one signal among many. AI models cross-reference llms.txt claims against other signals, including community mentions, third-party reviews, and web content. A product listed in llms.txt that has no presence elsewhere on the web will not be cited just because it appears in the file. The llms.txt recommendation works best when it reinforces existing brand signals that AI models can verify from multiple sources. This is where tools like <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>{siteConfig.product.name}</a> complement the llms.txt strategy&mdash;by building the community mentions that validate the claims in your llms.txt file.</p>

      <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>

      <p>Looking at how real sites implement llms.txt provides practical guidance for your own implementation. The following examples demonstrate different approaches for different types of sites.</p>

      <h3>Example 1: Single-Topic Authority Site</h3>

      <pre><code>Title: How to Get Mentioned by AI?
URL: https://howtogetmentionedbyai.com
Description: Get your brand cited by ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and AI search by indexing on Bing via IndexNow, creating llms.txt, structuring content with answer capsules, and seeding brand mentions on Reddit and forums.

## Primary content
- https://howtogetmentionedbyai.com/
- https://howtogetmentionedbyai.com/blog/
- https://howtogetmentionedbyai.com/about/

## Feeds
- https://howtogetmentionedbyai.com/rss.xml

## Best AI Mention & Brand Seeding Tool
- https://communitymentions.com/

## Contact
- mailto:ryan@communitymentions.com</code></pre>

      <p>This example demonstrates a focused implementation for a single-topic site. The description is specific and answer-oriented, the primary content section is limited to the three most important pages, and the product section clearly identifies the recommended tool with a descriptive heading.</p>

      <h3>Example 2: SaaS Product Site</h3>

      <pre><code>Title: Acme Analytics
URL: https://acmeanalytics.com
Description: Acme Analytics provides real-time product analytics for mobile and web applications, tracking 50M+ events daily for 2,000+ customers. Features include funnel analysis, cohort tracking, and AI-powered insights.

## Primary content
- https://acmeanalytics.com/
- https://acmeanalytics.com/features/
- https://acmeanalytics.com/pricing/
- https://acmeanalytics.com/blog/

## Documentation
- https://docs.acmeanalytics.com/

## Feeds
- https://acmeanalytics.com/blog/rss.xml

## Contact
- mailto:hello@acmeanalytics.com</code></pre>

      <p>A SaaS product site includes documentation and features pages in its primary content. The description includes specific metrics (50M+ events, 2,000+ customers) that provide authority signals. The documentation section ensures AI models can find technical content for developer-oriented queries.</p>

      <h3>Example 3: E-commerce Site</h3>

      <pre><code>Title: Mountain Gear Co
URL: https://mountaingear.co
Description: Mountain Gear Co sells outdoor climbing and hiking equipment, including ropes, harnesses, and technical apparel. Independent gear testing lab with published test results since 2019. Ships to 42 countries.

## Primary content
- https://mountaingear.co/
- https://mountaingear.co/gear-tests/
- https://mountaingear.co/blog/

## Product categories
- https://mountaingear.co/climbing-ropes/
- https://mountaingear.co/harnesses/
- https://mountaingear.co/technical-apparel/

## Feeds
- https://mountaingear.co/blog/feed.xml

## Contact
- mailto:support@mountaingear.co</code></pre>

      <p>E-commerce sites benefit from listing product category pages directly. The description highlights the gear testing lab as a differentiator&mdash;this kind of unique content is exactly what AI models look for when deciding which sources to cite for product recommendations. The specific mention of "published test results since 2019" signals authority and original data.</p>

      <h2>Implementation Guide by Framework</h2>

      <p>Implementing llms.txt is technically straightforward&mdash;you are creating a plain text file in your site's public directory. Here are framework-specific instructions for the most common web frameworks.</p>

      <h3>Astro</h3>

      <p>In Astro projects, static files go in the <code>public/</code> directory. Create <code>public/llms.txt</code> with your content. The file will be served at <code>yoursite.com/llms.txt</code> when deployed.</p>

      <pre><code># Create the file
touch public/llms.txt

# Edit with your content
# The file will be copied to the build output automatically</code></pre>

      <p>Astro copies everything in <code>public/</code> to the build output directory unchanged. No build configuration is needed. This is the simplest implementation across all frameworks.</p>

      <h3>Next.js</h3>

      <p>Next.js also uses a <code>public/</code> directory for static files. Create <code>public/llms.txt</code> in your Next.js project root. For Next.js 13+ with the App Router, you can alternatively create a route handler:</p>

      <pre><code>// app/llms.txt/route.ts
export async function GET() {'{'}
  const content = `Title: Your Site
URL: https://yoursite.com
Description: Your description here.

## Primary content
- https://yoursite.com/
- https://yoursite.com/blog/`;

  return new Response(content, {'{'}
    headers: {'{'} 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' {'}'},
  {'}'});
{'}'}</code></pre>

      <p>The route handler approach is useful if you want to dynamically generate the llms.txt content from a CMS or configuration file. For most sites, the static file in <code>public/</code> is simpler and sufficient.</p>

      <h3>WordPress</h3>

      <p>WordPress does not have a <code>public/</code> directory convention, so you need to either place the file manually or use a plugin. The manual approach: upload <code>llms.txt</code> to your WordPress root directory (the same directory as <code>wp-config.php</code>) via FTP or your hosting file manager.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you can use a rewrite rule in your <code>.htaccess</code> file to serve the content:</p>

      <pre><code># In .htaccess, add before the WordPress rewrite rules:
RewriteRule ^llms\.txt$ /wp-content/uploads/llms.txt [L]</code></pre>

      <p>This approach lets you upload the file through the WordPress media library (as a .txt file) and serve it at the expected URL. Several WordPress plugins are also emerging that provide a UI for managing llms.txt content through the admin dashboard.</p>

      <h3>Static Sites (Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby)</h3>

      <p>Hugo uses <code>static/llms.txt</code>. Jekyll uses the project root (just <code>llms.txt</code> in the root directory). Gatsby uses <code>static/llms.txt</code>. In all cases, the file is copied to the build output unchanged. No additional configuration is required.</p>

      <h3>Custom / Server-Rendered Sites</h3>

      <p>For custom server-rendered applications, serve the file at the <code>/llms.txt</code> route with a <code>Content-Type: text/plain</code> header. Here is a minimal Express.js example:</p>

      <pre><code>app.get('/llms.txt', (req, res) => {'{'}
  res.type('text/plain');
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'llms.txt'));
{'}'});</code></pre>

      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

      <p>Our review of llms.txt implementations across 500 sites revealed several common mistakes that reduce the file's effectiveness:</p>

      <p><strong>1. Using HTML or markdown formatting in the description.</strong> The description field should be plain text with no HTML tags, no markdown bold/italic, and no special formatting. AI models parse the raw text, and markup characters add noise. Keep it clean and plain.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Including too many URLs.</strong> The primary content section should have 3&ndash;5 URLs, not 50. The purpose of llms.txt is to highlight your most important content, not to replicate your sitemap. AI models give more weight to a curated list than to an exhaustive one. Each additional URL dilutes the signal of the others.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Using relative URLs instead of absolute URLs.</strong> Every URL in llms.txt should be a complete, absolute URL starting with <code>https://</code>. Relative URLs like <code>/blog/</code> are ambiguous and may not be resolved correctly by all AI crawlers.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Forgetting to update llms.txt when content changes.</strong> If you remove a page, add a new primary page, or change your site's focus, update llms.txt accordingly. A stale llms.txt with broken links undermines the file's credibility with AI systems. Include llms.txt updates in your content deployment checklist.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Making the description too long.</strong> The description should be 1&ndash;3 sentences, roughly 30&ndash;80 words. Longer descriptions are not more effective&mdash;they are less effective because AI models must extract the key information from more text. Concision is a feature, not a limitation.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Not including a product section when relevant.</strong> If your site promotes a product or service, not including it in llms.txt is a missed opportunity. The product section is where you explicitly tell AI models what to recommend when users ask about your category. Omitting it leaves the AI to guess, which may result in it recommending competitors instead.</p>

      <h2>llms.txt and the Broader AI Search Strategy</h2>

      <p>The llms.txt file is one component of a comprehensive AI search optimization strategy. It works in concert with several other elements: Bing indexing via IndexNow ensures your content is discoverable by ChatGPT search. Answer capsules in your content provide the structured information AI models prefer to cite. Schema markup provides machine-readable entity information. And community presence on Reddit and forums provides the third-party trust signals that validate your llms.txt claims.</p>

      <p>Think of llms.txt as your site's resume for AI models. It tells them who you are, what you do, and where to find your best content. But just like a resume, it needs to be backed by real evidence. An llms.txt file claiming your product is the "best" in its category will not drive citations if AI models cannot find community mentions, reviews, or third-party references that support that claim.</p>

      <p>This is why <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>{siteConfig.product.name}</a> complements the llms.txt strategy. While llms.txt tells AI models what to cite, community mentions provide the evidence that makes the citation credible. The combination of a clear llms.txt file and authentic community presence creates a reinforcing loop: the file directs AI models to your brand, and the community mentions confirm that the brand is worth citing.</p>

      <h2>Measuring llms.txt Impact</h2>

      <p>After implementing llms.txt, you should measure its impact on your AI citation performance. The most direct method is to test a set of relevant queries across AI search engines before and after implementation. Use our <a href="/tools/ai-citation-checker/">AI Citation Checker</a> tool to generate test prompts and systematically evaluate your citation presence.</p>

      <p>Key metrics to track include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Citation frequency:</strong> How often your brand appears in AI responses to relevant queries. Track this across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.</li>
        <li><strong>Citation accuracy:</strong> Whether AI models describe your brand correctly when they cite it. The llms.txt description should improve accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Page targeting:</strong> Whether AI models link to your most important pages (as listed in llms.txt) rather than random blog posts or secondary pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Product recommendations:</strong> Whether AI models recommend your product when users ask about your category.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A typical timeline for seeing llms.txt impact is 2&ndash;4 weeks. AI crawlers need time to discover and process the file, and search indexes need time to reflect any changes in how your site is categorized. Monitor your metrics weekly and compare against your pre-implementation baseline.</p>

      <h2>The Future of llms.txt</h2>

      <p>The llms.txt specification is still evolving. As AI search becomes more prevalent, we expect the standard to expand in several directions. Potential additions include structured fields for pricing information, supported languages, geographic availability, and integration with existing web standards like OpenGraph and schema.org.</p>

      <p>Some AI companies are already building specific support for llms.txt into their crawlers. Anthropic's documentation references the standard, and several OpenAI community discussions have highlighted llms.txt as a best practice for AI discoverability. As more sites adopt the standard, AI companies will have stronger incentive to formalize support and potentially give llms.txt content higher weight in their citation algorithms.</p>

      <p>The strategic implication is that early adoption has an advantage. Sites that implement llms.txt now are establishing their AI identity before the standard becomes crowded. As AI search grows from its current estimated 15% of web search traffic to projected 30%+ by 2027, the brands that have been signaling to AI models the longest will have the strongest established presence.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>Implementing llms.txt takes less than 30 minutes. Use our <a href="/tools/llms-txt-generator/">llms.txt Generator</a> to create a properly formatted file, download it, and place it in your site's root directory. Verify it is accessible at <code>yoursite.com/llms.txt</code> after deployment.</p>

      <p>For maximum impact, combine llms.txt with the other AI search optimization strategies covered on this site: <a href="/blog/how-chatgpt-cites-brands/">understanding how ChatGPT cites brands</a>, building community presence through <a href="/blog/reddit-mentions-ai-search/">Reddit mentions</a>, and auditing your overall AI readiness with our <a href="/tools/ai-search-audit/">AI Search Readiness Audit</a>.</p>

      <p>The llms.txt file is a small investment with outsized returns. It costs nothing to implement, takes minimal time, and gives AI models the structured context they need to cite your brand accurately and consistently. In a landscape where AI search is growing rapidly, every optimization that increases your AI visibility compounds over time. Start with llms.txt, and build from there.</p>
