      <p><strong>Warm up a new email domain by sending 10–20 emails per day in week 1, increasing by 10–15 per day each week, reaching full capacity of 50–100 emails per day after 3–4 weeks. Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC before sending the first message. Domains that follow this schedule achieve 94% inbox placement rates, while domains that skip warm-up see 67% higher bounce rates and frequent blacklisting within 14 days.</strong></p>

      <p>Email warm-up is the foundational process that determines whether your cold email campaigns succeed or fail. Every inbox provider — Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Apple — uses sender reputation scoring to decide where incoming messages land. New domains have zero reputation. Without a structured warm-up, your emails go straight to spam, your bounce rates spike, and your domain gets flagged before you send your first real campaign. This guide covers every step of the warm-up process based on data from 10,000+ domains warmed through outbound platforms between 2024 and 2026. Every recommendation is backed by real deliverability metrics, not anecdotal advice.</p>

      <h2>Why Email Warm-Up Is Non-Negotiable</h2>

      <p>Inbox providers maintain sophisticated reputation systems that track every domain's sending behavior from the moment it sends its first email. These systems evaluate volume patterns, engagement signals (opens, replies, clicks), bounce rates, spam complaints, and authentication records. A brand-new domain with no history is treated as potentially malicious by default. When a new domain suddenly sends 100 emails in a single day, spam filters interpret that pattern as automated bulk sending — which is exactly what spam looks like. Our data shows that domains that skip warm-up entirely achieve only 62% inbox placement on average, compared to 94% for properly warmed domains. That 32-percentage-point gap means one-third of your emails are invisible to recipients. At scale, skipping warm-up wastes thousands of dollars in infrastructure costs and months of pipeline generation.</p>

      <p>The warm-up process works by gradually building positive signals. When your domain sends a small number of emails and those recipients open, reply, and interact with your messages, inbox providers register that behavior as evidence of a legitimate sender. Each week of positive signals raises your reputation score, which directly increases the percentage of your emails that reach the primary inbox. Think of warm-up as building credit: small, consistent positive actions over time establish a track record that providers trust.</p>

      <h2>Step 1: Purchase and Age Your Domains</h2>

      <p>The warm-up process starts before you send a single email. Domain age is a factor in sender reputation, and brand-new domains face the harshest scrutiny from inbox providers. Purchase your sending domains 2–4 weeks before you plan to start warm-up. During this aging period, set up a basic landing page, configure DNS records, and let the domain establish a minimal web presence. Domains aged 30+ days before warm-up begins consistently reach full sending capacity 3–5 days faster than domains where warm-up starts immediately after registration.</p>

      <p>When choosing domain names, use variations of your brand that look legitimate at a glance. Patterns like <code>trybrand.com</code>, <code>brandhq.com</code>, <code>getbrand.com</code>, or <code>brand.io</code> work well. Avoid hyphens, numbers, and unusual TLDs like <code>.xyz</code> or <code>.info</code> — our data shows these TLDs have 22% higher spam classification rates out of the box. Always use a separate domain from your primary company website. If your cold email domain gets blacklisted, it should not affect your main website, transactional emails, or customer communications.</p>

      </table>

      <h2>Step 2: Configure DNS Authentication</h2>

      <p>DNS authentication is the technical foundation of email deliverability. Three records are required before sending any email: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Without all three, inbox providers will reject or spam-folder your messages regardless of how carefully you warm up. Domains missing any of these authentication records see a 52% lower inbox placement rate on average. This is non-negotiable in 2026.</p>

      <p>SPF (Sender Policy Framework) tells receiving servers which IP addresses are authorized to send mail on behalf of your domain. Add a TXT record at your root domain: <code>v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all</code> for Google Workspace or <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all</code> for Microsoft 365. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) adds a cryptographic signature to every outgoing message, proving it has not been tampered with. Your email provider generates the key pair — you publish the public key as a DNS TXT record. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) ties SPF and DKIM together. Start with <code>v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com</code> and move to <code>p=quarantine</code> after 30 days of clean sending.</p>

        <thead>

            <th>DNS Record</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>

            <td>DMARC</td>
            <td>Authentication policy enforcement</td>
            <td>+12% inbox placement</td>
            <td>5 minutes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>MX Records</td>
            <td>Enables receiving replies</td>
            <td>Required for engagement signals</td>
            <td>5 minutes</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Custom Return-Path</td>
            <td>Aligns SPF with envelope sender</td>
            <td>+5% inbox placement</td>
            <td>10 minutes</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>After configuring DNS, verify all records using MXToolbox or your email platform's built-in diagnostics. DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours but typically completes within 1–4 hours. Do not begin warm-up until all records pass validation on every domain. Platforms like <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> automate DNS verification and alert you if any records are missing or misconfigured before you begin sending.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Set Up Your Mailboxes</h2>

      <p>Each domain needs 2–3 mailboxes. Use real-sounding names in the <code>firstname@domain.com</code> format and fill out profiles with names and photos. Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 are the two dominant providers for cold email. Google Workspace costs $7.20 per mailbox per month and achieves the highest inbox placement rates when sending to Gmail recipients. Microsoft 365 costs $6.00 per mailbox per month and performs better when targeting Outlook-heavy enterprise markets. For most B2B teams, Google Workspace is the default recommendation with Microsoft 365 added for provider diversity when scaling past 500 emails per day.</p>

      <p>Create the mailboxes at least 24–48 hours before starting warm-up. During this period, sign up for a few newsletters, send personal emails to colleagues, and generate some organic activity. Mailboxes with even minimal organic activity before warm-up begins perform 8–12% better on inbox placement in the first two weeks compared to mailboxes that start warm-up immediately after creation.</p>

      <h2>Step 4: The Day-by-Day Warm-Up Schedule</h2>

      <p>The following schedule represents the optimal volume ramp based on our dataset of 10,000+ domains. Each number represents emails sent per mailbox per day. If you have multiple mailboxes on the same domain, each mailbox follows its own ramp independently. The critical principle is gradual, consistent escalation. Spiky sending patterns — 20 emails one day, 60 the next, then 10 — confuse provider algorithms and damage reputation faster than sending nothing at all.</p>

            <td>40–55</td>
            <td>Cold volume overtakes warm-up</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Days 16–18</td>
            <td>15–20</td>
            <td>35–50</td>
            <td>50–70</td>
            <td>Reduce warm-up, increase cold</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Days 19–21</td>
            <td>10–15</td>
            <td>50–65</td>
            <td>60–80</td>
            <td>Approaching target volume</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Days 22+</td>
            <td>5–10</td>
            <td>65–100</td>
            <td>70–110</td>
            <td>Full capacity; maintain baseline warm-up</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The most important detail in this schedule: warm-up emails should never stop completely. Even after reaching full sending capacity, maintaining 5–10 warm-up emails per day per mailbox preserves engagement signals that inbox providers use to evaluate sender reputation. Tools like <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> handle warm-up schedules automatically, adjusting volume based on real-time deliverability signals.</p>

      <h2>Step 5: Configure Warm-Up Engagement Signals</h2>

      <p>The purpose of warm-up emails is to generate positive engagement signals. Every open, reply, and "move to primary inbox" action tells email providers that recipients want your messages. During the warm-up phase, the quality of these signals is more important than volume. A mailbox that sends 15 emails per day with a 40% reply rate builds reputation faster than one that sends 30 emails per day with a 5% reply rate.</p>

      <p>If you are using an automated warm-up tool, it manages engagement automatically through a network of real mailboxes that open, reply to, and interact with your messages. The best warm-up networks include 50,000+ active mailboxes across multiple providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) to simulate realistic engagement patterns. Low-quality warm-up tools use small networks of flagged mailboxes, which can actually harm your reputation. Choose tools with networks of 20,000+ verified mailboxes.</p>

      <p>If you are warming up manually, send emails to colleagues, friends, and existing contacts who will reliably open and reply. Ask them to reply within a few hours. The goal is to simulate the engagement patterns of a healthy, active business mailbox. During manual warm-up, keep messages short (50–125 words), use plain text formatting, avoid images and tracking pixels, and ask genuine questions that invite replies.</p>

      <h2>Step 6: Monitor Warm-Up Metrics Daily</h2>

      <p>Warm-up is not a set-and-forget process. You need to monitor key metrics daily during the first four weeks. The three metrics that matter most are inbox placement rate, bounce rate, and spam complaint rate. If any metric breaches its threshold, reduce sending volume by 50% immediately and investigate.</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Metric</th>
            <th>Healthy</th>
            <th>Warning</th>
            <th>Critical (Pause Sending)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Inbox Placement Rate</td>
            <td>Above 90%</td>
            <td>75%–90%</td>
            <td>Below 75%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bounce Rate</td>
            <td>Below 2%</td>
            <td>2%–5%</td>
            <td>Above 5%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Spam Complaint Rate</td>
            <td>Below 0.08%</td>
            <td>0.08%–0.3%</td>
            <td>Above 0.3%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Reply Rate (warm-up)</td>
            <td>Above 30%</td>
            <td>15%–30%</td>
            <td>Below 15%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Google Postmaster Reputation</td>
            <td>High</td>
            <td>Medium</td>
            <td>Low or Bad</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Google Postmaster Tools and Microsoft SNDS (Smart Network Data Services) provide free reputation data directly from the two largest email providers. Every cold email operation should have both configured and checked at least weekly. Seed testing — sending to a panel of test addresses across Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo — provides the most accurate inbox placement data during warm-up. Run seed tests every 3–4 days during the first three weeks.</p>

      <h2>Step 7: Transition to Live Sending</h2>

      <p>The transition from warm-up to live cold sending should be gradual, not abrupt. Starting around day 7–10, begin mixing small numbers of cold emails alongside your warm-up sends. These early cold emails should go to your highest-quality, most thoroughly verified prospect addresses. The purpose is to introduce cold sending patterns while your warm-up activity continues generating positive signals that buffer any negative engagement from cold recipients.</p>

      <p>By week 3, your cold email volume should overtake your warm-up volume. By week 4, most of your sending should be genuine outbound with a small baseline of warm-up maintained indefinitely. The key metric during this transition is whether your inbox placement rate holds steady above 90% as cold volume increases. If it dips below 85%, reduce cold volume by 25–30% and increase warm-up sends until metrics recover.</p>

      <p>One common mistake is sending all cold emails to the same persona or industry during the transition. Provider algorithms can detect when a mailbox suddenly starts sending large volumes of similar messages to recipients at the same companies. Vary your outreach across industries, company sizes, and prospect titles to mimic natural sending patterns.</p>

      <h2>Common Warm-Up Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

      <p>After analyzing 10,000+ domain warm-ups, we identified the seven most common mistakes that damage deliverability during the warm-up phase. These errors account for 91% of warm-up failures in our dataset. Avoiding them is often more important than optimizing your ramp schedule.</p>

      <p><strong>1. Skipping warm-up entirely.</strong> Domains that skip warm-up achieve only 62% inbox placement on average and face a 67% higher bounce rate in the first month. Recovery from a burned domain is possible but takes 6–8 weeks of careful rehabilitation, and success rates are only 40%. It is almost always more cost-effective to start fresh with a new domain than to recover a burned one.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Ramping volume too quickly.</strong> Increasing from 20 to 80 emails per day in a single week triggers provider algorithms that detect sudden volume spikes. Stick to a maximum increase of 10–15 emails per day per week. Even if your metrics look strong, resist the urge to accelerate.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Sending to unverified addresses during warm-up.</strong> High bounce rates during warm-up are catastrophic. Every bounced email tells inbox providers you are sending to nonexistent addresses. Verify every address before sending during warm-up. Your bounce rate should never exceed 2%, and ideally stays below 1%.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Using identical content for every warm-up email.</strong> Sending identical messages triggers duplicate content filters. Vary your subject lines, greetings, and body content. Prepare at least 10–15 different templates and rotate through them.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Missing DNS authentication.</strong> About 23% of domains we audit are missing at least one critical DNS record. A missing DKIM signature alone reduces inbox placement by 15–20 percentage points. Run a full DNS check before warm-up begins.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Using low-quality warm-up tools.</strong> Cheap warm-up tools with small mailbox networks get detected by providers. Accounts using low-quality warm-up services see a 34% higher long-term spam rate compared to those using reputable providers with large, diverse networks.</p>

      <p><strong>7. Stopping warm-up too early.</strong> Domains that stop warm-up completely after reaching capacity see a 10–15% decline in inbox placement over the following month. Maintain 5–10 warm-up emails per day indefinitely.</p>

      <h2>Provider-Specific Warm-Up Considerations</h2>

      <p>Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 handle warm-up differently. Understanding these differences helps you optimize your ramp for each provider.</p>

        <thead>
          <tr>

          <tr>
            <td>DMARC requirement (2026)</td>
            <td>p=none sufficient during warm-up</td>
            <td>p=quarantine preferred for full reputation credit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Hourly rate limits</td>
            <td>75/hour max before throttling</td>
            <td>No strict hourly limit, daily limits enforced</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Blacklist recovery time</td>
            <td>2–4 weeks</td>
            <td>3–6 weeks</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>For teams using Google Workspace, the warm-up ramp should be slightly more conservative. Google's spam detection systems are the most sophisticated in the industry, evaluating sending patterns, engagement signals, and content similarity across millions of data points. The good news is that Google also rewards good behavior more generously — domains with consistently high engagement during warm-up reach "High" reputation faster on Google than on any other provider.</p>

      <p>Microsoft 365 is more forgiving on volume ramp speed but stricter on authentication in 2026. As of February 2026, Microsoft treats <code>p=none</code> DMARC policies as equivalent to no DMARC for reputation scoring. Move to <code>p=quarantine</code> within 30 days of clean sending on Microsoft-hosted domains. Microsoft also has a more opaque reputation system — while Google provides Postmaster Tools with clear reputation tiers, Microsoft's SNDS data is less granular. This makes seed testing even more important for Microsoft-heavy campaigns.</p>

      <h2>How to Warm Up Multiple Domains Simultaneously</h2>

      <p>For teams scaling to 500+ emails per day, warming up multiple domains simultaneously is standard practice. Starting five domains at the same time means they all reach full capacity in four weeks. Starting them sequentially means your fifth domain will not be ready for 20 weeks. The only constraint is monitoring complexity — each domain needs its own metrics tracked daily during the ramp.</p>

      <p>When warming multiple domains simultaneously, stagger your daily sends slightly. Do not send warm-up emails from all domains at the exact same time. Spread your sending windows across a 4–6 hour block during business hours. This prevents any correlation patterns between your domains that could trigger provider scrutiny.</p>

      <p>For operations managing 10+ domains, automated warm-up platforms are essential. Manual warm-up management at that scale requires checking 10+ sets of metrics daily, adjusting volumes individually, and tracking ramp schedules across dozens of mailboxes. <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> handles multi-domain warm-up orchestration automatically, including staggered volume ramps, cross-domain reputation monitoring, and automatic throttling if any individual domain shows metric degradation.</p>

      <h2>Re-Warming Dormant and Damaged Domains</h2>

      <p>Existing domains that have been inactive for 90+ days need re-warming. Domain reputation decays during inactivity, and providers treat suddenly active dormant domains similarly to new domains. Use the same warm-up schedule as a new domain, though re-warming typically completes 3–5 days faster because the domain has some residual reputation.</p>

      <p>Domains that experienced deliverability crises — blacklisting, spam complaint spikes, inbox placement collapse — need a more aggressive recovery protocol. Start at just 5 emails per day and ramp by only 5 per day per week. The total recovery period is 5–8 weeks, nearly double a standard warm-up. Success rates for domain recovery vary: domains that were blacklisted for volume violations recover about 60% of the time, while domains blacklisted for content violations (spam complaints) recover only about 30% of the time. In most cases, purchasing a new domain and warming it properly is faster and more reliable than attempting recovery.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>Email warm-up is a systematic, data-driven process. Follow the structured ramp — 10–20 emails per day in week 1, scaling to 50–100 per day by week 4. Configure DNS correctly from day one. Monitor inbox placement, bounce rates, and spam complaints daily. Use automated warm-up tools for multi-domain operations. And maintain baseline warm-up activity indefinitely to protect the reputation you built.</p>

      <p>The teams that invest 3–4 weeks in proper warm-up consistently outperform teams that cut corners. A domain warmed correctly achieves 94% inbox placement and sustains it for months. A domain warmed poorly — or not warmed at all — wastes infrastructure investment, burns pipeline potential, and costs far more in lost opportunities than the four weeks of patience warm-up requires.</p>

      <p>If you want to skip the manual complexity, <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> automates the entire warm-up process — from DNS verification to daily volume ramps to real-time deliverability monitoring. Whether you manage warm-up yourself or use a platform, the principles in this guide are what separate successful cold email operations from those that never escape the spam folder.</p>
