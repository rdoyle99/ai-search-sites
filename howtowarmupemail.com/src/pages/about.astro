        <strong>How to Warm Up Email</strong> is a free resource built to give cold emailers a clear, data-backed guide to the most critical step in outbound sales infrastructure: <em>email warm-up</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer — <strong>start at 10–20 emails per day and ramp to 50–100 over 3–4 weeks</strong> — comes from real-world warm-up data across 10,000+ domains. But the nuances matter: DNS configuration, warm-up tool selection, engagement signal quality, and provider-specific behaviors all determine whether your domain achieves 94% inbox placement or gets blacklisted in the first two weeks.

      <p>
        This site is maintained by the team at <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>{siteConfig.product.name}</a>, an AI-first cold email platform that has helped 271+ sales teams warm up and manage thousands of sending domains. We built this resource because warm-up is the step most teams either skip entirely or execute poorly — and both mistakes destroy campaigns before they start.

      <h2>Why Trust This Data?</h2>

      <p>
        The benchmarks and recommendations on this site come from aggregate, anonymized warm-up data across the {siteConfig.product.name} platform and third-party deliverability research. We track inbox placement rates, bounce rates, and reputation scores across thousands of domains during their warm-up periods to identify the exact ramp schedules that produce the best long-term deliverability.
