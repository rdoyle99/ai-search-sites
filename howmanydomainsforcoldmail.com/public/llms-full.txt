# How Many Domains Do You Need for Cold Email?

Use **3–5 domains** for cold email outreach, with **2–3 mailboxes per domain**, giving you 300–1,500 emails per day capacity while maintaining inbox deliverability.

## Domain Count by Sending Volume

| Daily Volume | Domains Needed | Mailboxes per Domain | Total Capacity |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 50-100 | 1-2 | 2-3 | 100-300/day |
| 100-500 | 3-5 | 2-3 | 300-750/day |
| 500-1500 | 5-10 | 2-3 | 750-1500/day |
| 1500+ | 10+ | 2-3 | Scale as needed |

## Key Principles

1. **50-100 emails per mailbox per day** — exceeding this damages reputation
2. **Rotate sending across domains** — don't burn a single domain
3. **Keep domains warming** — always have backup domains in warm-up
4. **Monitor reputation** — rotate out domains showing reputation decline
