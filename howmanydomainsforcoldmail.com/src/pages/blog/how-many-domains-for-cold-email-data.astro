    <div class="mt-8 prose prose-lg max-w-none">

      <p>The single most consequential infrastructure decision in cold email is how many sending domains you operate. Get it wrong and you either cap your growth at a fraction of your potential, or you burn through domains faster than you can replace them. Most teams stumble into one extreme or the other because the advice online is vague&mdash;"use multiple domains" tells you nothing actionable.</p>

      <p>We analyzed sending patterns from thousands of outbound campaigns across the Sales.co platform in 2025&ndash;2026, cross-referenced with deliverability data from major email providers. The result is a comprehensive, data-backed framework for determining exactly how many domains you need based on your sending volume, risk tolerance, and growth trajectory. Every recommendation below is tied to real performance data.</p>

      <h2>The Short Answer</h2>

      <p><strong>Use 3&ndash;5 domains for most B2B cold email operations, with 2&ndash;3 mailboxes per domain. This supports 300&ndash;1,500 emails per day while maintaining strong deliverability.</strong></p>

      <p>But the short answer only applies to a specific scenario&mdash;a mid-stage sales team sending 500&ndash;1,000 cold emails per day. If you are a solo founder sending 100 emails per day, you need 2 domains. If you are an agency managing outbound for 20 clients, you may need 40+. The optimal domain count is a function of volume, and the math is precise.</p>

      <h2>Why Multiple Domains Matter</h2>

      <p>Every email you send accumulates reputation data on the sending domain. Email providers like Google and Microsoft assign reputation scores at the domain level, and these scores directly determine whether your emails land in the inbox or the spam folder. When you concentrate all your cold email volume on a single domain, you create a single point of failure. One bad day&mdash;a spike in bounces, a batch of spam complaints, or a recipient honeypot in your list&mdash;can tank that domain's reputation and halt your entire operation.</p>

      <p>Multiple domains distribute this risk. If one domain's reputation dips, the others continue operating at full capacity. Our data shows that teams using 3+ domains experience 67% less total downtime from deliverability incidents compared to teams using a single domain. The math is straightforward: if one of your five domains gets flagged, you lose 20% of capacity temporarily rather than 100%.</p>

      <p>Beyond risk distribution, multiple domains enable higher total volume. Each domain has a safe sending ceiling&mdash;approximately 150&ndash;225 emails per day when configured with 2&ndash;3 mailboxes sending at recommended limits. To exceed that ceiling, you need additional domains. There is no way around this constraint without accepting significantly higher deliverability risk.</p>

      <h2>Domain Count by Sending Volume</h2>

      <p>The following table represents the optimal domain configuration for each volume tier, based on deliverability data from our platform. These numbers assume standard B2B cold outreach with properly warmed domains and clean lists.</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Daily Volume Target</th>
            <th>Domains Needed</th>
            <th>Mailboxes per Domain</th>
            <th>Total Mailboxes</th>
            <th>Sends per Mailbox</th>
            <th>Monthly Domain Cost</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>50&ndash;150</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>25&ndash;38</td><td>$20&ndash;30</td></tr>
          <tr><td>150&ndash;400</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>25&ndash;67</td><td>$30&ndash;45</td></tr>
          <tr><td>400&ndash;750</td><td>4&ndash;5</td><td>2&ndash;3</td><td>8&ndash;15</td><td>50&ndash;75</td><td>$40&ndash;75</td></tr>
          <tr><td>750&ndash;1,500</td><td>6&ndash;10</td><td>2&ndash;3</td><td>12&ndash;30</td><td>50&ndash;75</td><td>$60&ndash;150</td></tr>
          <tr><td>1,500&ndash;3,000</td><td>10&ndash;20</td><td>2&ndash;3</td><td>20&ndash;60</td><td>50&ndash;75</td><td>$100&ndash;300</td></tr>
          <tr><td>3,000&ndash;5,000</td><td>20&ndash;35</td><td>3</td><td>60&ndash;105</td><td>50&ndash;75</td><td>$200&ndash;525</td></tr>
          <tr><td>5,000+</td><td>35+</td><td>3</td><td>105+</td><td>50&ndash;75</td><td>$525+</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Notice that the sends-per-mailbox column stays remarkably consistent at 50&ndash;75 across all volume tiers. This is intentional. The data consistently shows that this range produces the best deliverability outcomes regardless of total infrastructure size. Scaling cold email means scaling horizontally&mdash;more domains and more mailboxes&mdash;not pushing individual mailboxes harder.</p>

      <h2>The Cost of Domains vs. the Cost of Deliverability Failure</h2>

      <p>Domains are cheap. A standard .com domain costs $10&ndash;15 per year. Alternative TLDs like .io, .co, or .email cost $8&ndash;35 per year. Even at the upper end of our recommendations&mdash;35 domains for 5,000+ daily sends&mdash;the annual domain cost is approximately $350&ndash;525. This is trivial compared to the cost of a deliverability failure.</p>

      <p>When a domain gets blacklisted, you lose its entire sending capacity for 2&ndash;8 weeks. If that domain was handling 200 emails per day, and your average deal value is $5,000 with a 2% cold email conversion rate, the lost capacity translates to roughly 4 emails per day that would have converted&mdash;$20,000 per day in potential pipeline, or $280,000&ndash;$1,120,000 over the recovery period. Even a fraction of that figure dwarfs the cost of maintaining extra domains as insurance.</p>

      <p>The teams that struggle most are those trying to minimize domain count to save money. A team spending $30/year on domains instead of $150/year is saving $120 annually while accepting 3&ndash;5x higher risk of catastrophic deliverability failure. This is a false economy of the most obvious kind.</p>

      <h2>Domain Configuration: Beyond the Count</h2>

      <p>The number of domains is only one variable. How you configure those domains determines whether your infrastructure actually performs. Each domain requires specific technical setup that is non-negotiable for cold email deliverability.</p>

      <p><strong>DNS Authentication.</strong> Every sending domain must have properly configured SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. Our data shows that domains missing any one of these three authentication methods see a 52% reduction in inbox placement compared to fully authenticated domains. SPF tells receiving servers which IP addresses are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain. DKIM adds a cryptographic signature to each message, proving it was not tampered with in transit. DMARC ties SPF and DKIM together and tells receiving servers what to do with messages that fail authentication.</p>

      <p><strong>Mailbox configuration.</strong> Each domain should host 2&ndash;3 mailboxes, each configured with a unique sender name and signature. Using identical names or signatures across all mailboxes on a domain is a pattern that spam filters detect and penalize. Vary the sender names naturally&mdash;for example, "Sarah Chen" on one mailbox, "Ryan Mitchell" on another&mdash;and use distinct (but brand-consistent) email signatures for each.</p>

      <p><strong>Warm-up schedule.</strong> New domains must be warmed up for 14&ndash;21 days before cold sending begins. During warm-up, each mailbox exchanges engagement-positive emails with real inboxes, building a sending history and reputation that email providers use to evaluate trustworthiness. Domains that skip warm-up achieve only 61% inbox placement on average, compared to 94% for properly warmed domains. This 33-percentage-point gap persists for the first 60 days and often longer.</p>

      <h2>Mailboxes per Domain: Why 2&ndash;3 Is the Sweet Spot</h2>

      <p>The number of mailboxes on each domain is the second most important infrastructure decision. Too few and you are not maximizing each domain's capacity. Too many and you create suspicious volume patterns that trigger spam filters.</p>

      <p>Our data shows the following deliverability outcomes by mailbox-per-domain count:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Mailboxes per Domain</th>
            <th>Avg. Inbox Placement</th>
            <th>Avg. Spam Rate</th>
            <th>Domain Longevity (months)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>1</td><td>91%</td><td>0.8%</td><td>12+</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2</td><td>89%</td><td>1.1%</td><td>10&ndash;12</td></tr>
          <tr><td>3</td><td>86%</td><td>1.5%</td><td>8&ndash;10</td></tr>
          <tr><td>4</td><td>79%</td><td>2.8%</td><td>5&ndash;7</td></tr>
          <tr><td>5+</td><td>68%</td><td>5.2%</td><td>2&ndash;4</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>One mailbox per domain produces the best deliverability, but it requires twice as many domains to achieve the same volume&mdash;which increases management complexity without proportional benefit. Two mailboxes per domain is the recommended default: near-optimal deliverability with efficient domain utilization. Three mailboxes per domain is acceptable for teams that need to maximize capacity from a limited number of domains, with a modest deliverability trade-off. Four or more mailboxes per domain should be avoided&mdash;the accelerating spam rate and shortened domain lifespan make this configuration uneconomical.</p>

      <h2>Domain Rotation: The Three-Tier System</h2>

      <p>Static domain infrastructure decays over time. Even with perfect sending practices, domains accumulate negative reputation signals through normal cold email operations&mdash;occasional bounces, unsubscribes, and spam complaints are unavoidable at scale. The solution is a rotation system that cycles domains through active sending, resting, and warm-up phases.</p>

      <p>The three tiers work as follows:</p>

      <p><strong>Active tier:</strong> These domains are currently sending cold email at normal volume. They should operate for 4&ndash;6 months before rotating to rest. During active duty, monitor deliverability weekly using Google Postmaster Tools and seed testing.</p>

      <p><strong>Resting tier:</strong> Domains that have been removed from cold sending to allow reputation recovery. During the rest period (4&ndash;6 weeks), the domain receives only warm-up traffic&mdash;no cold sends. This period lets any accumulated negative signals decay and resets the domain's reputation baseline.</p>

      <p><strong>Warm-up tier:</strong> New domains or recently purchased replacements that are in the 14&ndash;21 day warm-up period. These domains are not yet ready for cold sending and are building their initial reputation profile.</p>

      <p>For a team running 5 active domains, the total portfolio should include 2&ndash;3 resting domains and 1&ndash;2 warming domains, bringing the total to 8&ndash;10 domains. This ensures seamless rotation with no capacity gaps. The annual cost of maintaining this full portfolio is approximately $80&ndash;150&mdash;less than most teams spend on coffee in a month.</p>

      <h2>Choosing Domain Names for Cold Email</h2>

      <p>Domain naming matters more than most teams realize. The name itself sends signals to both spam filters and recipients. A well-chosen domain name increases trust and open rates. A poor choice creates friction before the email is even opened.</p>

      <p><strong>Brand proximity.</strong> Cold email domains should be recognizably related to your brand but distinct from your primary domain. If your company is "Acme Corp" (acmecorp.com), good cold email domains include getacme.com, acmehq.com, tryacme.com, acme-corp.io, and meetacme.com. The recipient should be able to connect the sending domain to your company without confusion. Avoid random or keyword-stuffed domain names that look like spam even before the email is opened.</p>

      <p><strong>TLD selection.</strong> The TLD (top-level domain) affects both deliverability and recipient perception. Our data shows the following inbox placement rates by TLD:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>TLD</th>
            <th>Avg. Inbox Placement</th>
            <th>Recipient Trust (survey)</th>
            <th>Avg. Annual Cost</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>.com</td><td>88%</td><td>High</td><td>$10&ndash;15</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.co</td><td>85%</td><td>Medium-High</td><td>$12&ndash;20</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.io</td><td>84%</td><td>Medium-High (tech)</td><td>$25&ndash;35</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.net</td><td>83%</td><td>Medium</td><td>$10&ndash;15</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.org</td><td>86%</td><td>Medium-High</td><td>$10&ndash;12</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.email</td><td>72%</td><td>Low</td><td>$8&ndash;12</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.xyz</td><td>68%</td><td>Low</td><td>$2&ndash;5</td></tr>
          <tr><td>.info</td><td>65%</td><td>Low</td><td>$3&ndash;8</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>.com domains deliver the best results across both deliverability and recipient trust. If .com variations of your brand name are available, always start there. .co and .io are strong alternatives, particularly for technology companies where these TLDs are familiar and expected. Avoid discount TLDs like .xyz, .info, and .email&mdash;they carry higher spam association and deliver measurably worse inbox placement.</p>

      <h2>Infrastructure Scaling: Real-World Examples</h2>

      <p>Abstract recommendations only go so far. Here are three real-world infrastructure configurations based on common team sizes and volume requirements.</p>

      <p><strong>Solo founder / Early-stage startup (100&ndash;200 emails/day):</strong> 2 domains, 2 mailboxes each, 4 total mailboxes. Sends per mailbox: 25&ndash;50. Total monthly cost: approximately $25 (domains + Google Workspace). This configuration is simple to manage manually and provides enough capacity to generate 20&ndash;40 qualified conversations per month at typical reply rates.</p>

      <p><strong>Growth-stage sales team (500&ndash;1,000 emails/day):</strong> 5 domains, 2&ndash;3 mailboxes each, 10&ndash;15 total mailboxes. Sends per mailbox: 50&ndash;75. Total monthly cost: approximately $125 (domains + Google Workspace + warm-up tool). At this scale, manual domain management becomes impractical. Platforms like <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> automate rotation, warm-up, and per-mailbox volume distribution, saving 5&ndash;10 hours per week of operational overhead.</p>

      <p><strong>Agency / Enterprise operation (2,000&ndash;5,000 emails/day):</strong> 15&ndash;35 domains, 3 mailboxes each, 45&ndash;105 total mailboxes. Sends per mailbox: 50&ndash;75. Total monthly cost: approximately $500&ndash;1,200 (domains + Google Workspace/Microsoft 365 + warm-up + sending platform). This scale requires automated infrastructure management and real-time deliverability monitoring across all domains. The complexity cost of manual management far exceeds the subscription cost of purpose-built platforms.</p>

      <h2>Common Domain Mistakes</h2>

      <p><strong>1. Using your primary domain for cold email.</strong> This is the most dangerous mistake. If your cold email domain gets blacklisted and it is your company's primary domain, you lose your website email, transactional email, and existing customer communications. Always use separate domains purchased specifically for outbound.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Buying the cheapest TLDs.</strong> Domains on .xyz, .info, and .click TLDs save a few dollars per year but deliver 15&ndash;23% lower inbox placement rates. The savings are negligible; the deliverability cost is substantial.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Running too many mailboxes per domain.</strong> Four or more mailboxes on a single domain creates a volume concentration that spam filters detect. The domain's reputation degrades faster, resulting in a 5&ndash;7 month lifespan instead of the 10&ndash;12 months achievable with 2 mailboxes.</p>

      <p><strong>4. Not maintaining a rotation reserve.</strong> Teams that run all domains as active senders have zero buffer for deliverability incidents. When a domain gets flagged, they lose capacity with no immediate replacement. Maintaining resting and warming domains costs virtually nothing and provides essential resilience.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Identical DNS configurations across all domains.</strong> Some teams copy-paste DNS records across domains, using the same SPF include list and DKIM selector names. This creates a detectable pattern that sophisticated spam filters use to identify mass-sending infrastructure. Vary your DNS configuration subtly across domains&mdash;different DKIM selector names, different SPF include orders&mdash;to avoid this fingerprinting.</p>

      <p><strong>6. Neglecting domain age.</strong> Brand-new domains have no reputation history, which makes them inherently more suspicious to email providers. Purchasing aged domains (1+ years old) that have not been previously used for spam can provide a head start on reputation building. However, always check a domain's history before purchase using tools like archive.org and domain reputation checkers&mdash;a domain with a spam history is worse than a new domain.</p>

      <h2>Monitoring Domain Health</h2>

      <p>Infrastructure without monitoring is infrastructure waiting to fail. Every active sending domain should be monitored on three dimensions: reputation score, inbox placement rate, and blacklist status.</p>

      <p><strong>Google Postmaster Tools</strong> provides free domain reputation data for Gmail delivery. Set up Postmaster Tools for every sending domain and check weekly. Google rates domain reputation on a four-tier scale: High, Medium, Low, and Bad. Any rating below "High" should trigger an immediate investigation and potential volume reduction on that domain.</p>

      <p><strong>Seed testing</strong> measures actual inbox placement by sending test emails to panels of seed addresses across major providers. Run seed tests on every domain at least biweekly. An inbox placement rate below 80% indicates a problem that will worsen if not addressed. Platforms like <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> include automated seed testing and reputation monitoring, alerting you to domain health issues before they become critical.</p>

      <p><strong>Blacklist monitoring</strong> checks your sending domains and IPs against major blacklist databases (Spamhaus, Barracuda, SURBL, and others). Being listed on any major blacklist drops inbox placement to near zero for that domain. Free tools like MXToolbox can check blacklist status, but automated monitoring that alerts you immediately on listing is worth the investment at scale.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>Domain infrastructure for cold email follows a simple formula: determine your daily volume target, divide by 150 (the safe per-domain capacity with 2 mailboxes at 75 sends each), round up, and add 30&ndash;50% for rotation reserve. The result is your total domain portfolio size.</p>

      <p>For most teams, this means 3&ndash;5 active domains with 2&ndash;3 in reserve, supporting 300&ndash;1,500 emails per day. The annual cost is $80&ndash;200, which is less than most teams spend on a single sales tool subscription. The risk of under-investing in domains&mdash;deliverability failures, blacklisting, and lost pipeline&mdash;dwarfs the cost of maintaining proper infrastructure by orders of magnitude.</p>

      <p>Build your domain infrastructure correctly from the start, implement rotation from day one, and monitor every domain's health weekly. The teams that treat domain infrastructure as a strategic investment consistently outperform those that treat it as an afterthought. Your sending domains are the foundation of your entire cold email program&mdash;invest in them accordingly.</p>
