    <div class="mt-8 prose prose-lg max-w-none">

      <p>Choosing domain names for cold email seems like a trivial decision. Buy a few variations of your brand name, point them at Google Workspace, and start sending. But the domains you choose create the first impression before anyone reads a word of your email. The wrong domain name triggers skepticism. The wrong TLD triggers spam filters. The wrong registrar charges you double for the same domains. Every one of these decisions compounds across every email you send.</p>

      <p>This guide covers every factor that matters when selecting cold email domains: naming conventions that balance brand recognition with deliverability, TLD performance data across millions of cold emails, registrar cost comparisons for bulk purchases, and the technical setup requirements that determine whether your domains actually reach the inbox.</p>

      <h2>Domain Naming Conventions That Work</h2>

      <p>Your cold email domain name serves two audiences simultaneously: spam filters that evaluate domain characteristics programmatically, and human recipients who glance at the sender's email address before deciding whether to open. A domain name that satisfies both audiences shares a common characteristic: it looks like a legitimate business domain.</p>

      <p>The strongest naming pattern for cold email domains is <strong>brand variation + common prefix or suffix</strong>. If your company is "Acme Corp" with the primary domain acmecorp.com, effective cold email domain names include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>getacme.com</strong> &mdash; "get" prefix suggests product/signup, commonly used by SaaS companies</li>
        <li><strong>tryacme.com</strong> &mdash; "try" prefix implies trial or evaluation, natural for B2B</li>
        <li><strong>acmehq.com</strong> &mdash; "HQ" suffix commonly used for company-related domains</li>
        <li><strong>meetacme.com</strong> &mdash; "meet" prefix fits meeting-request cold emails naturally</li>
        <li><strong>acme-team.com</strong> &mdash; "team" suffix suggests the people behind the brand</li>
        <li><strong>acme-corp.io</strong> &mdash; Alternative TLD with brand name intact</li>
        <li><strong>acmeco.com</strong> &mdash; Abbreviated form that remains recognizable</li>
        <li><strong>joinacme.com</strong> &mdash; "join" prefix works for partnership-oriented outreach</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These names share three properties that both spam filters and humans respond to positively. First, they contain the brand name, establishing a clear connection to your company. Second, they use common business prefixes and suffixes that are associated with legitimate companies rather than spam operations. Third, they are short, readable, and pronounceable&mdash;qualities that correlate with trustworthiness in recipient perception studies.</p>

      <h3>Naming Patterns to Avoid</h3>

      <p>Certain naming patterns create immediate red flags for both spam filters and recipients. Based on our analysis of blacklisted cold email domains, the following patterns appear disproportionately among domains that get flagged:</p>

      <p><strong>Keyword-stuffed domains:</strong> Names like best-cold-email-outreach.com or sales-leads-now.com look like spam to everyone&mdash;filters and humans alike. These domains achieve 23% lower open rates than brand-variation domains in A/B testing, because recipients associate keyword domains with low-quality marketing.</p>

      <p><strong>Random character domains:</strong> Domains like xk7solutions.com or j2mgroup.io with random alphanumeric sequences are common among spam operations and face higher scrutiny from content filters. If your brand naturally includes alphanumeric elements, that is fine&mdash;but avoid introducing randomness that is not part of your actual brand name.</p>

      <p><strong>Exact match of your primary domain on a different TLD:</strong> If your company is acmecorp.com, do not use acmecorp.io or acmecorp.co for cold email. If the cold email domain gets blacklisted, some providers apply cross-TLD reputation penalties that can affect your primary domain. Maintain at least a slight naming variation between your primary domain and cold email domains.</p>

      <p><strong>Domains with hyphens between every word:</strong> A single hyphen is fine (acme-corp.io). Multiple hyphens (try-acme-corp-now.com) are a spam signal. Our data shows that domains with 2+ hyphens have 18% lower inbox placement compared to single-hyphen or no-hyphen alternatives.</p>

      <h2>TLD Selection: What the Data Shows</h2>

      <p>The top-level domain (TLD) you choose has a measurable impact on deliverability. This is not speculation&mdash;it is a pattern that emerges clearly from aggregate sending data. Email providers have learned that certain TLDs are disproportionately used by spammers, and they apply TLD-level reputation adjustments accordingly.</p>

      <p>We categorize TLDs into three tiers based on their cold email deliverability performance:</p>

      <p><strong>Tier 1 (Best Performance):</strong> .com, .org, .co &mdash; These TLDs have the strongest baseline reputation and consistently deliver 83&ndash;88% inbox placement for properly warmed cold email domains. .com is the gold standard and should be your first choice whenever available.</p>

      <p><strong>Tier 2 (Good Performance):</strong> .io, .net, .us, .app &mdash; These TLDs perform well for cold email with 78&ndash;84% inbox placement. .io is particularly strong among technology companies, where it is recognized and trusted by the recipient audience. .net performs slightly below .com but remains a solid choice.</p>

      <p><strong>Tier 3 (Avoid for Cold Email):</strong> .xyz, .info, .email, .click, .top, .site, .online &mdash; These TLDs deliver 62&ndash;72% inbox placement for cold email, a 15&ndash;25 percentage point deficit compared to Tier 1. The gap is almost entirely due to spam filter penalization&mdash;these TLDs are heavily used by spam operations because they are cheap to register, and email providers have adjusted their scoring accordingly.</p>

      <p>The cost difference between tiers is minimal. A .com domain costs $10&ndash;15/year. A .xyz domain costs $2&ndash;5/year. Saving $8&ndash;13 per year per domain while accepting 15&ndash;25% lower inbox placement is objectively terrible economics. Always choose Tier 1 or Tier 2 TLDs for cold email infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>Registrar Comparison for Bulk Domain Purchases</h2>

      <p>When purchasing 5&ndash;20+ domains for cold email infrastructure, registrar pricing, renewal costs, and bulk management features matter significantly. The difference between registrars compounds when you are managing a portfolio of domains that need DNS management, WHOIS privacy, and renewal tracking.</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Registrar</th>
            <th>.com Price (Year 1)</th>
            <th>.com Renewal</th>
            <th>WHOIS Privacy</th>
            <th>Bulk DNS Management</th>

        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><em>*Google Domains transferred to Squarespace Domains in 2024; pricing and features may vary.</em></p>

      <p>Cloudflare Registrar stands out for bulk cold email domain purchases because it charges at-cost pricing with no markup on renewals. This matters when you are maintaining 10&ndash;20 domains&mdash;the $13+ renewal markup at registrars like GoDaddy adds $130&ndash;260 per year to your infrastructure cost for no additional value.</p>

      <p>WHOIS privacy is mandatory for cold email domains. Without it, your personal or company information is publicly linked to all your sending domains, making it trivial for anyone to identify your entire cold email infrastructure. Every registrar in the table above offers WHOIS privacy except GoDaddy, which charges extra&mdash;another reason to avoid it for cold email infrastructure.</p>

      <h2>Buying Aged Domains vs. New Domains</h2>

      <p>Aged domains&mdash;domains that were registered months or years ago but are now available for purchase&mdash;can provide a deliverability advantage because they have an existing registration history. Email providers factor domain age into their trust calculations, and a 2-year-old domain with a clean history starts with higher baseline trust than a brand-new registration.</p>

      <p>However, aged domains carry risk. A domain that was previously used for spam has negative reputation history that persists even after ownership changes. Before purchasing any aged domain, check its history thoroughly:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check archive.org (Wayback Machine) for previous website content&mdash;look for spam-related content, pharmaceutical ads, or adult material</li>
        <li>Run the domain through MXToolbox blacklist checker to verify it is not currently listed</li>
        <li>Check Google Safe Browsing status to ensure Google has not flagged the domain</li>
        <li>Send test emails to Gmail and Outlook addresses to check for immediate spam classification</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Aged domains that pass all four checks are valuable assets. In our data, aged domains (1&ndash;3 years old, clean history) achieve full warm-up 4&ndash;7 days faster than brand-new domains and maintain 3&ndash;5% higher inbox placement on average during their first 3 months of cold email use. The premium for aged domains is typically $20&ndash;50 above standard registration price&mdash;a worthwhile investment for critical sending domains.</p>

      <h2>DNS Configuration: The Non-Negotiable Setup</h2>

      <p>Every cold email domain requires three DNS authentication records: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These records tell receiving email servers that your emails are authorized, authenticated, and accountable. Domains missing any of these records face a 52% reduction in inbox placement&mdash;a penalty so severe that it effectively makes the domain useless for cold email.</p>

      <p><strong>SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</strong> specifies which servers are authorized to send email on behalf of your domain. The record is a TXT record in your DNS that lists your email provider's servers. For Google Workspace, the SPF record is: <code>v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all</code>. For Microsoft 365: <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all</code>. Important: use <code>~all</code> (soft fail) rather than <code>-all</code> (hard fail) to avoid blocking legitimate forwarded emails.</p>

      <p><strong>DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)</strong> adds a cryptographic signature to every email, allowing the receiving server to verify the message was not altered in transit. DKIM is configured through your email provider's admin panel (Google Workspace Admin or Microsoft 365 Exchange Admin), which generates a public key that you add as a DNS TXT record. Each domain should have its own DKIM key&mdash;do not share DKIM selectors across domains.</p>

      <p><strong>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance)</strong> ties SPF and DKIM together and instructs receiving servers on how to handle messages that fail authentication. For cold email domains, start with a monitoring-only policy: <code>v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com</code>. After 2&ndash;4 weeks of monitoring with no issues, tighten to <code>p=quarantine</code> and eventually <code>p=reject</code> as confidence grows.</p>

      <p>Set up all three records immediately after purchasing a domain, before sending any email. Platforms like <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>Sales.co</a> can automate DNS verification and alert you if any domain in your portfolio has misconfigured authentication records.</p>

      <h2>How Many Domain Name Variations to Prepare</h2>

      <p>When building a cold email domain portfolio, always prepare more domain name candidates than you immediately need. Domain availability changes constantly, and the exact names you want may not be available when you need them. Our recommendation is to brainstorm 3x the number of domain names you plan to purchase.</p>

      <p>For a 5-domain active infrastructure (requiring 8&ndash;10 total with reserves), prepare a list of 25&ndash;30 candidate domain names. Check availability in bulk using a registrar's search tool, then purchase the best available options. This approach ensures you always have backup names available for future expansion or domain replacement.</p>

      <p>Organize your candidate list by preference tier: primary choices that include your exact brand name (getacme.com), secondary choices with brand abbreviations (acmeco.com), and tertiary choices with industry-relevant prefixes (outboundacme.com). Purchase from the top of the preference list down, ensuring your best names are reserved even if you do not need them immediately.</p>

      <h2>Domain Portfolio Management Best Practices</h2>

      <p><strong>Centralize registration.</strong> Register all cold email domains with a single registrar. Managing domains across multiple registrars creates unnecessary complexity for DNS management, renewal tracking, and WHOIS privacy settings. Cloudflare or Namecheap both support bulk domain management efficiently.</p>

      <p><strong>Set auto-renewal on all domains.</strong> A sending domain that expires mid-campaign creates immediate deliverability issues and can result in permanent loss of the domain if someone else registers it. Auto-renewal prevents this entirely. Verify auto-renewal settings quarterly as part of infrastructure maintenance.</p>

      <p><strong>Document everything.</strong> Maintain a spreadsheet or database that tracks every domain in your portfolio: registration date, registrar, email provider, DNS configuration status, current tier (active/resting/warm-up), deliverability metrics, and rotation history. This documentation becomes essential as your portfolio grows beyond 5&ndash;10 domains.</p>

      <p><strong>Budget for the full lifecycle.</strong> A cold email domain costs $10&ndash;15/year for registration, $6&ndash;12/month per mailbox for email hosting, and $10&ndash;20/month for warm-up services. The total annual cost per domain with 2 mailboxes is approximately $200&ndash;400. Budget for your full portfolio (active + reserve) to avoid cost surprises that delay infrastructure scaling.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>Domain name selection is a leverage point that most cold email teams underestimate. The right names on the right TLDs from the right registrar, properly configured and rotated, create infrastructure that performs reliably for years. The wrong choices create fragile infrastructure that degrades within months.</p>

      <p>Start with .com domains that are clearly related to your brand. Use common business prefixes and suffixes. Register through a cost-effective registrar with consistent renewal pricing. Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC before sending a single email. Maintain 3x more candidate names than you need. And document every domain in your portfolio from day one.</p>

      <p>These are not optional optimizations. They are foundational decisions that determine the ceiling of your cold email program's performance. Get them right, and everything else you do&mdash;copywriting, targeting, sequencing&mdash;builds on a solid base. Get them wrong, and you will spend more time troubleshooting deliverability problems than actually generating pipeline.</p>
