      <p>Most cold email guides focus on what to say. This one focuses on how it looks. Formatting — the visual structure of your email — affects reply rates almost as much as the copy itself. An identical message formatted as a wall of text versus three clean paragraphs can see a 40% difference in reply rates. Yet formatting remains one of the most overlooked aspects of cold email optimization.</p>

      <p>We analyzed formatting data from 1.8 million cold emails to identify the exact structural elements that maximize readability, engagement, and reply rates. Here's everything we found.</p>

      <h2>Why Formatting Matters More Than You Think</h2>

      <p>When a recipient opens your cold email, they make a split-second decision: read or delete. This decision happens before they process a single word. It's based entirely on the visual appearance of the email — how dense it looks, how long it appears, and whether it seems like a personal message or a marketing blast.</p>

      <p>Studies on email reading behavior show that recipients spend 1.3 seconds evaluating an email's visual format before deciding to read the content. In that 1.3 seconds, poor formatting (large text blocks, no whitespace, excessive length) triggers an automatic "delete" reflex. Good formatting (clean paragraphs, visible whitespace, reasonable length) earns you the next 5–10 seconds of actual reading.</p>

      <h2>The Optimal Email Structure</h2>

      <p>Based on our data, the highest-performing cold email structure follows this exact format:</p>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 1 (1–2 sentences, 15–25 words):</strong> The hook. A personalized opening that references something specific about the recipient — their company, a recent event, a mutual connection, or an observation about their business. This paragraph's job is to earn the next paragraph.</p>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 2 (2–3 sentences, 30–45 words):</strong> The value proposition. What you do, why it matters to them, and evidence it works. This is the core of your email. Keep it specific — "we helped [similar company] increase X by Y%" is much stronger than "we help companies grow."</p>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 3 (1 sentence, 8–15 words):</strong> The CTA. A soft, low-commitment ask. "Open to a 15-minute chat this week?" works. "Would you like to schedule a demo to see how our enterprise solution could transform your sales operations?" doesn't.</p>

      <p>This three-paragraph structure produces a 3.7% average reply rate — 52% higher than single-paragraph emails and 28% higher than four-or-more-paragraph emails.</p>

      <h2>Paragraph Length Rules</h2>

      <p>Long paragraphs kill cold emails. Our data shows clear thresholds:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Max Lines Per Paragraph</th>
            <th>Avg. Reply Rate</th>
            <th>Recommendation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>1–2 lines</td><td>3.5%</td><td>Optimal</td></tr>
          <tr><td>3 lines</td><td>2.9%</td><td>Acceptable</td></tr>
          <tr><td>4–5 lines</td><td>2.0%</td><td>Too long</td></tr>
          <tr><td>6+ lines</td><td>1.2%</td><td>Avoid</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>Keep every paragraph to 1–2 lines maximum. On mobile (where 67% of emails are first read), a 2-line paragraph on desktop becomes 4–5 lines, so what looks clean on your computer screen may look like a wall of text on a phone. Always test your emails on mobile before sending.</p>

      <h2>Sentence Length</h2>

      <p>Short sentences outperform long sentences in cold email. The data is unambiguous:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Under 10 words per sentence (average):</strong> 3.6% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>10–15 words per sentence:</strong> 3.2% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>15–20 words per sentence:</strong> 2.4% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>20+ words per sentence:</strong> 1.5% reply rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Aim for 8–12 words per sentence on average. Mix sentence lengths for natural rhythm — a 5-word sentence followed by a 15-word sentence reads more naturally than five 10-word sentences in a row. But never exceed 20 words in any single sentence. Long sentences force the reader to hold too many ideas in working memory, which reduces comprehension and makes your email feel like work.</p>

      <h2>Whitespace Ratio</h2>

      <p>Whitespace — the empty space between paragraphs, around text, and in line breaks — is a critical but invisible formatting element. Emails with more whitespace feel shorter, lighter, and more inviting, even when the word count is identical.</p>

      <p>We measured whitespace ratio as the percentage of visible email area that contains no text. The optimal ratio:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>45–55% whitespace:</strong> 3.4% reply rate (optimal)</li>
        <li><strong>35–45% whitespace:</strong> 2.8% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>25–35% whitespace:</strong> 2.0% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>Under 25% whitespace:</strong> 1.3% reply rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The simplest way to increase whitespace: use paragraph breaks aggressively. Every 1–2 sentences should be its own paragraph. Don't worry about traditional writing conventions — cold emails aren't essays. Short, separated paragraphs create the visual lightness that encourages reading.</p>

      <h2>Mobile Formatting</h2>

      <p>67% of B2B emails are first opened on mobile devices. Mobile formatting is not optional — it's the primary design constraint. Rules for mobile optimization:</p>

      <p><strong>Preview text optimization.</strong> The email preview (shown before opening) displays 35–90 characters depending on the device and email client. Your first sentence needs to hook the reader within this preview window. Front-load the most compelling part of your message.</p>

      <p><strong>No images.</strong> Images in cold emails trigger spam filters, slow load times on mobile, and are often blocked by default in email clients. The best cold emails are plain text only. Our data shows plain text emails achieve 23% higher reply rates than emails with images.</p>

      <p><strong>No HTML formatting.</strong> Bold, italics, colored text, and fancy formatting look like marketing emails. Cold emails should look like personal messages. Plain text, standard font, no colors, no formatting. The only exception: a natural-looking email signature.</p>

      <p><strong>Link placement.</strong> If you must include a link, place it on its own line with whitespace above and below. Links embedded within sentences are harder to tap on mobile and look more like marketing emails. Better yet, don't include any links in the initial cold email — save them for follow-ups after the recipient has expressed interest.</p>

      <h2>Signature Formatting</h2>

      <p>Your email signature is often the longest element in a cold email — and if formatted poorly, it can make the entire email feel heavy and cluttered. Signature best practices:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep it to 3–4 lines:</strong> Name, title, company, phone number. That's it.</li>
        <li><strong>No images or logos:</strong> They trigger spam filters and add visual weight</li>
        <li><strong>No banners or promotional links:</strong> Calendar booking links, social media icons, and marketing banners make your "personal" email look automated</li>
        <li><strong>No quotes or disclaimers:</strong> Inspirational quotes, legal disclaimers, and confidentiality notices add unnecessary length</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The ideal signature is 3 lines of plain text. On mobile, a minimal signature keeps the total email length manageable and preserves the personal, one-to-one feeling that drives replies.</p>

      <h2>Bullet Points and Lists</h2>

      <p>Should you use bullet points in cold emails? The data is mixed:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>No bullets (pure paragraphs):</strong> 3.2% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>1 short list (2–3 bullets):</strong> 3.0% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple lists or long lists:</strong> 1.8% reply rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Bullet points can work in specific contexts — for example, listing 2–3 specific results you've achieved for similar companies. But they tend to make emails feel more like marketing materials than personal messages. Use them sparingly, if at all. When you do, keep lists to 2–3 items maximum.</p>

      <h2>Question Marks and CTAs</h2>

      <p>The number and placement of question marks in your email affects reply behavior:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1 question mark (at the end, as CTA):</strong> 3.8% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>2 question marks:</strong> 2.9% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>3+ question marks:</strong> 1.7% reply rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>One question — your CTA — placed as the final sentence of your email. That's the optimal format. Multiple questions create decision paralysis and make the recipient unsure which one to answer. They also make your email feel like an interrogation rather than a conversation.</p>

      <h2>Capitalization and Punctuation</h2>

      <p>Excessive capitalization (ALL CAPS words), exclamation points, and special characters (!!, ??, ***) are strong spam signals for both email filters and human readers:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>No caps, no exclamation points:</strong> 3.3% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>1 exclamation point:</strong> 2.8% reply rate</li>
        <li><strong>2+ exclamation points or any ALL CAPS:</strong> 1.4% reply rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Write your cold email like you'd write to a colleague. Normal capitalization, periods, and the occasional comma. No exclamation points (they read as fake enthusiasm), no ALL CAPS (they read as shouting), and no special character emphasis.</p>

      <h2>The Complete Formatting Checklist</h2>

      <p>Before sending any cold email, verify these formatting elements:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Total word count: 50–125 words</li>
        <li>Paragraph count: 2–3 paragraphs</li>
        <li>Max paragraph length: 2 lines</li>
        <li>Average sentence length: 8–12 words</li>
        <li>Question marks: exactly 1 (the CTA)</li>
        <li>Exclamation points: 0</li>
        <li>ALL CAPS words: 0</li>
        <li>Links: 0 (in initial email)</li>
        <li>Images: 0</li>
        <li>HTML formatting: none (plain text)</li>
        <li>Signature: 3–4 lines, plain text</li>
        <li>Mobile preview: first sentence hooks within 50 characters</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Run every cold email through this checklist. It takes 30 seconds and can double your reply rate. The best performing cold emails in our dataset — 4%+ reply rates — followed every single one of these formatting rules.</p>
