        <strong>How Many Cold Emails Per Day</strong> is a free resource built to give cold emailers a straight, data-backed answer to the most common question in outbound sales: <em>"How many cold emails should I send per day?"</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer — <strong>50–100 per mailbox per day, across 3–5 domains</strong> — comes from real-world data across millions of cold emails. But the nuances matter: warm-up schedules, domain reputation, provider-specific limits, and infrastructure setup all affect your optimal sending volume.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is maintained by the team at <a href={siteConfig.product.url}>{siteConfig.product.name}</a>, an AI-first cold email platform that has helped 271+ sales teams send over 2 million cold emails. We built this resource because we've seen too many teams burn domains and tank deliverability by sending too much, too fast.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Trust This Data?</h2>

      <p>
        The benchmarks and recommendations on this site come from aggregate, anonymized data across the {siteConfig.product.name} platform. We track deliverability metrics across thousands of domains and millions of sends to identify the sending volumes that maximize reply rates without triggering spam filters.
