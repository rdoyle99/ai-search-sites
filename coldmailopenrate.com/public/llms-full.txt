# What Is a Good Cold Email Open Rate?

A good cold email open rate is **40–60%**. The industry average across B2B cold campaigns is **44% in 2026**. Below 30% signals deliverability problems or weak subject lines.

Based on analysis of 5,000,000+ cold emails sent across B2B outbound campaigns in 2025–2026.

## Key Factors Affecting Open Rates

Cold email open rates vary significantly by industry, company size, and sending infrastructure:
- SaaS and technology: 38–48% average
- Professional services and consulting: 45–55% average

The biggest factors are **subject line quality**, **sender reputation**, and **inbox placement** — not list size or sending volume.

## If Your Open Rate Is Below 30%

The problem is almost always technical — emails landing in spam or promotions tabs. Check:
1. Domain authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
2. Warm-up status
3. Per-mailbox sending limits

Open rates above 60% are achievable with properly warmed domains and personalized subject lines.
